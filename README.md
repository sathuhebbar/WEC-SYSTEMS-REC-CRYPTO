# WEC-SYSTEMS-REC-CRYPTO
WEC Systems Recruitment Crypto Task

The zip file and image given are also here.
The QR part of the image has been cut and put in QR.jpg.
There is also the unzipped dontsee.txt.
The stage-<number>.txt files contain the ciphers obtained at each stage.
The final.txt file contains the final message. 
The script can be run to produce all these files.
But opening the zip will be required.

  
Thank you!
